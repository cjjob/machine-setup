I write in this repo like I think.
This is the last properly constructed paragraph that you'll see.
Be kind. Have fun.

configs across all os's. organised into logical sections of tools that belong together.

## Key remapping

10/10 would recommend.
standalone. sits 'above' everything else.
useful for everyone.
makes you go fast(er). not vim fast (stay humble vim nerds).
but fast in real world (outside editors, like youtube and google docs, or notion if you swing that way)

rationale:

- caps lock *key* is super useful. no one uses caps lock. so re-use the key.
- i used to play games. wasd (or ijkl, what i actually use) already is arrows in my head.
  - actual arrows are far from home. like e.t.
- feels difficult at first. truly **automatic** when used to it.
  - ^good life lesson, btw.
- pareto principle. 80-20. lots of bang for buck.
  - meaning, you don't need all of vims fanciness (though that is awesome).
  - you learn to press caps + ijkl (or hjkl), you save tens/hundreds of hours across your life.
    - unless you get hit by bus tomorrow.

## Future work

though, honestly, not even read article properly yet.
unclear how well it will work with repo when repo got this dir structure.
